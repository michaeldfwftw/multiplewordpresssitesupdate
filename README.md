# multiplewordpresssitesupdate
This is a simple automator that I built for me; I then changed it up a bit by removing my websites and passwords. It won't work for you as-is. 
Here are the changes you HAVE TO make:
 1. for each site that you want to have automatically updated, fill in the username and password for the site in the beginning. I also recommend changing the variable to a logical         one. So if your site was www.myfridgeforpresident2020.com, I might make the variables fridgeusee and fridgepass. 
 2. you have to fill in the actual urls of the sites. If you use a standard https://myfridgeforpresident2020.com/wp-admin then you only have to fill in the URL; if you us sub-folders make sure you add those in.

Additionally, this is set to work with Firefox as a browser, multiple tabs supported in order of opening (rather than of last use) and with tab keys for navigation. Minimal edits could get this working in Safari or Chrome easily. 

I don't plan to support this. It works for me. I am sharing as is because it might work for others, too. Feel free to fork it and make it cooler. 

I don't use TOAST, or any other "tell the user what is happening" type code. Not my style.
